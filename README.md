## Overview

This repository contains a basic implementation of a neural network built from scratch in Python. The project aims to demonstrate the key concepts behind neural networks, such as forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization techniques. It is intended as an educational tool for understanding how neural networks function under the hood.

## Features

- **Feedforward Neural Network**: Includes an implementation of a simple feedforward neural network with a customizable number of layers and neurons.
- **Backpropagation**: Implements the backpropagation algorithm for training the network.
- **Activation Functions**: Supports several activation functions, including sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax.
- **Optimization**: Implements gradient descent for optimizing the network's weights.
- **Loss Function**: Includes common loss functions such as mean squared error (MSE) and cross-entropy loss.
- **Pytorch Implementation**: Inlcudes pytorch implementation of Deep Learning Neural Networks.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need Python 3.6+ and the following libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib (for visualizing the training process)
- pandas (optional, for data processing)
- pytorch (for deep learning model support)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
